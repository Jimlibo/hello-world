# hello-world
My first repository

This repository was made in order for me to understand the basics of github. It contains some small projects in C++,
although it should not be identified as a repository dedicated to the above programming language. It also contains a pdf file
that lists the projects that i had to make in order to get specific certifications from www.freecodecamp.org . These projects
include ML projects, data analysis projects, and also some simpler scientific computing projects, using python.
